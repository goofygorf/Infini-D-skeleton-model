Well, here it is.   Not perfect, but I guess it looks human enough.   Everything is linked with some constraints.  I'll explain some of the idiosyncracies.  The whole body is parented to one large box.  The upper body from the pelvis up is parented to a cube in the pelvis that allows the body to bend down at the hips.  Each vertabrae is successively linked to the one above it up to the skull.  The first 5 vert. can be rotated to bend the spine below the ribs.  The verts from 18 up the the skull can be rotated to bend the neck.  Do not rotate the verts. between 5 & 18 as this will throw the ribs out of alignment with the verts.  The lower arm must be rotated by the parent cube at the elbow.  To rotate the hands you must rotate the Radius by using Shift/Roll (the third rotate tool).  The Radius must be clicked on the end of the bounding box to rotate properly.  This is necessary in order to link the hand to the proper center of rotation related to the Radius.  The Radius actually turns the hand just as in the real body.   Be careful, this is a delicate linkage that can get thrown out of wack easily.  Also, be careful of the left hand.  If you unlink it for any reason it will flip out of rotation alignment and it will be difficult to get it back.   This is because it was made by negatively scaling a duplicate of the other hand.  When it is unlinked it reverts to its original orientation.   The feet do not have this problem.
